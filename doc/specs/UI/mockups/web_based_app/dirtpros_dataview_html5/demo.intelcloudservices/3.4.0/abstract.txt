This sample demonstrates the use of the Intel Cloud Services Platfrom (CSP) Identity service
to authenticate the user of your mobile application.

The sample application presents a login button that when pressed requests the CSP identity service
authenticate the user.  This authentication process requires the application contain a valid
CSP client id and secret key. To obtain these two values, follow the instructions here:

Specifically, when registering your application, enable the Identity service.  For the callback URN, you may
enter: urn:intel:identity:oauth:oob:async

The application uses the following libraries: jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap and Bootbox.
